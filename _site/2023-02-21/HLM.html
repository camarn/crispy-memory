<p>Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) also known as multi-level modeling (MLM), is a statistical procedure often used in HR to analyze data that is organized hierarchically, also known as nested data. HLM allows HR professionals to examine nested data and shows how variables at different levels of the organization impact each other. For instance, analysts may look at the effects of individual characteristics on team performance, or the impact of team characteristics on employee behavior. The data structures in organizations are often more complicated, having individuals nested in teams, teams nested in departments, and departments further nested in separate geographic locations. HLM is important because it allows analysts to develop more effective strategies and interventions based on understanding the relationships between organizational and individual-level factors.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Examine the structure of your data - make sure your data is nested</li>
  <li>Organize data, clean &amp; merge data, identify missing data, &amp; create dummy variables as necessary to prepare data to be analyzed</li>
  <li>Examine several models using multiple goodness-of-fit methods to identify best model</li>
  <li>Center model if needed and re-run analysis</li>
  <li>Interpret results</li>
</ol>
