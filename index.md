# About This Site
  Welcome to my personal website, where I am pleased to share my projects and interests with potential employers and associates. As an HR analyst, I specialize in using data analytics and statistical methods to solve workforce-related problems and achieve organizational goals.  I take pride in my ability to identify and analyze critical information and effectively communicate findings with stakeholders. I possess experience and training in various HR functions, such as Learning & Development, Talent Acquisition, and Performance Management. I used R Markdown and Jekyll to create this website. Feel free to get in touch.
